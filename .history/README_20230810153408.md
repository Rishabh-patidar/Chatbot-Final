<!-- Explanation of the React.js `app.js` file:

1. `import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';`: This line imports the necessary modules from the React library.

2. `function App() { ... }`: This is the main component of your React app. It defines the behavior and layout of your chatbot user interface.

3. `useState` and `useEffect`: These are React hooks used to manage state and perform side effects respectively.

4. `inputText` and `setInputText`: These variables hold the user's input text and the function to update it.

5. `chatHistory` and `setChatHistory`: These variables hold the chat history and the function to update it.

6. `handleInputChange`: This function handles the change event of the input field and updates `inputText`.

7. `handleSend`: This function sends the user's input to the FastAPI backend, receives the bot's response, and updates the chat history.

8. `return`: The JSX code that defines the layout of your chatbot user interface.

Explanation of the FastAPI `app.py` file:

1. `from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException`: These lines import the necessary modules from the FastAPI library.

2. `from pydantic import BaseModel`: This line imports `BaseModel` from the Pydantic library, which is used for defining request and response models.

3. `from typing import List`: This line imports the `List` type from the Python `typing` module.

4. `app = FastAPI()`: This line initializes a FastAPI instance.

5. `class Message(BaseModel): ...`: This defines a Pydantic model `Message` with a single field `text`.

6. `class BotResponse(BaseModel): ...`: This defines a Pydantic model `BotResponse` with a single field `response`.

7. `@app.post("/process_input/", response_model=BotResponse)`: This is a

FastAPI route decorator that listens for POST requests at the specified path and returns a `BotResponse`.

8. `def process_input(message: Message): ...`: This function handles the POST request. It takes a `Message` object as input, processes the bot's response (replace with your actual bot logic), and returns a `BotResponse`. -->
